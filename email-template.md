Hey fam! Thanks for getting your picks in for the <year> Wonky Pickins 3rd/4th Round Playoff Poolstravaganza!

All the rosters have been set up in the website but you'll need to log out of the other pool and log in again with different credentials to see this one:

Pool Name: Wonky Pickins <year>
Password: <pwd>

If you notice anything was entered incorrectly with your roster, just let me know.

The first (for points) bonus question will be coming your way in WhatsApp tomorrow morning.

Wonky luck everyone!
